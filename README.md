# [Microtext.js] Demo

This is a demo project for comparing the processing time of a huge amount of strings processed by Rails helpers and other methods versus JavaScript methods (executed by the user's browser instead of the application server)

The goal is to show that [Microtext.js] can improve Rails pages' rendering time by delegating some string processing routines to the user's browser, thus diminishing the burden on the server side.
